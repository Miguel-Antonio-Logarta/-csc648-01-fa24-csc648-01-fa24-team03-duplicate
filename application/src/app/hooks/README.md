## Custom Hooks
- These hooks are meant to be used in the frontend where they are CLIENT COMPONENETS
- We use these custom hooks because we want to abstract away the messy useEffect logical code from the .tsx files that mainly contains html + tailwindcss code.

- Create more as needed:
- ideally need to create hooks for creating bookmarks given locationid

### Note: Backend needs to create theses apis first before we can create these hooks
- need to create some for deletion of locations, reviews, bookmarks
- need to create some for updating location
- Search hook
